                    Tomorrowland is a Belgian electronic dance music festival held in Boom, Flanders, Belgium
                        since 2005.

                    <p>On March 20, 2013, ID&T Belgium and SFX Entertainment announced that it would begin
                        organizing an American spin-off of Tomorrowland, known as TomorrowWorld.[70] The
                        festival is held at the Bouckaert Farm in Chattahoochee Hills, Georgia, located 48
                        kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Atlanta. The site was specifically chosen due to its
                        resemblance to the Boom location in which Tomorrowland is traditionally held.
                        The inaugural edition of TomorrowWorld, held 27, 28, and 29 September 2013, reused the
                        "Book of Wisdom" design used for the main stage at Tomorrowland in 2012. The festival
                        played host to over 140,000 attendees over the weekend. TomorrowWorld brought more than
                        music, dancing and stunning visuals to the area that year - it brought an economic
                        boost. Officials reported TomorrowWorld 2013 brought $85.1 million into the Georgia
                        economy, including $70 million directly to Atlanta. That $70 million matches the impact
                        the city got from hosting the NCAA Final Four in 2013.
                        Nearly 140,000 attended the event, and their direct expenditures added $28.7 million
                        into the local economy in areas such as lodging, restaurants and sight-seeing,
                        TomorrowWorld officials said.
                        The 2014 edition of TomorrowWorld was held on 26, 27, and 28 September 2014. The theme
                        was "The Arising of Life," and used the volcano main stage which debuted at Tomorrowland
                        in 2013. The festival hosted a pre-festival concert called "The Gathering" on Thursday
                        25 September 2014 for attendees staying in Dreamville, the camp grounds of
                        TomorrowWorld. Over 40,000 people camped at Dreamville, selling out the basic camping
                        option. More than 160,000 people attended TomorrowWorld 2014.
                        The third and final edition of TomorrowWorld was held on the weekend of September 25,
                        26, and 27 2015. The event descended into chaos after being marred by inclement
                        weather.Rain showers resulted in muddy terrain at the festival grounds, and entrance
                        roadways to the grounds becoming unusable. On Saturday, due to the road conditions,
                        organizers restricted shuttle service for attendees traveling back to Atlanta; those who
                        were not stranded without shelter at the grounds overnight were required to hike miles
                        towards areas where taxi cab and Uber drivers offered rides back to Atlanta at high
                        prices. The following morning, festival organizers announced that the remainder of the
                        festival would only be open to those who had camped on-site, and that refunds would be
                        issued to those who were affected by the transport issues or had bought tickets for day
                        3.
                        On March 2, 2016, the official TomorrowWorld Facebook page announced that the festival
                        will not be held in 2016. со всего мира; а также местные бельгийские деликатесы.</p>
